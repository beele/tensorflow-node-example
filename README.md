# tensorflow-node-example

Basic repo that shows Node.js integration with Tensorflow.js

Please consult the node-canvas docs for any prerequisites that are required prior to running `npm install`
This is espicially the case on ARM linux!

Equally make sure you have xcode installed and xcode tools agreed to:  
`sudo xcodebuild -license`  
If yoo still have issues:

Run `npm run test` or `npm run start` to either run the test or the application.
Both functionally do the same.
